I used "www.codecademy.com/courses/fizzbuzz" to get a basic understanding of looping and
to output the Fizz Buzz.

I studied the ObjectSample specs and the spec I wrote for fizz buzz in Ruby to write them in javascript. However, due to an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at ".../jasmine.js:796"" I couldn't run the test and see if they worked as expected.
